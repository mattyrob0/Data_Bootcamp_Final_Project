    "NYU Students frequently pass by film sets while walking around Greenwich Village and the surrounding area. Actor & actress trailers can be found on a regular basis, and brands such as Cadillac are known to frequently shoot in the SoHo area. In 2010, then-Mayor [Michael Bloomberg enacted a $300 processing fee](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/7638566/New-York-to-charge-300-for-filming-permits.html) for film permits. This was met with some backlash, but nevertheless, NYC has remained a hot location to film.\n",
    "\n",
    "NYC has a vibrant arts scene, and that includes film & television. Since January 1st 2012 there have been over 49,000 film permits filed with the NYC Mayor's office. That's an average of over 20 per day. Because Lower Manhattan is regarded as a very affluent area within NYC, one might hypothesize that this means that more filming is done in this area. \n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, this project will explore the question: **Where are people filming in Manhattan?**\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, this project will explore at a zip code level what the most popular zip codes are for filming. This will be done year-to-year. Furthermore, knowing how different seasons provide different opportunities to film, this project will also see how much shifting there is between popular zip codes by season. Going back to the hypothesis that filming is being predominantly done in higher-income areas, this project will look at how strong of a correlation there is—if any—between zip code income and amount of permits. Finally, this project will evaluate shifts in the data, comparing the first three years of data to the most recent three years. This will provide a glimpse into which areas are growing and declining in popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will utilize the database of [NYC film permits](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Film-Permits/tg4x-b46p/data), sourced from the NYC Open Data website. This database is updated frequently, and will still work with the setup below barring any unusual changes."

    "\n",
    "1. Film Permits have been largely concentrated in the lower half of Manhattan\n",
    "2. Although this distribution looks similar to a median income map, there is no correlation\n",
    "3. The top zip code for filming is in Hell's Kitchen\n",
    "4. The top zip codes have hardly changed over the past 6 years\n",
    "5. The top 10 zip codes do not change by season with only slight order variation for some zip codes\n",

    "7. There is no correlation between relative permit popularity growth and income level for each zip code\n",

    "When setting out on this project, the hypothesis was made that there was an inherent correlation between the number of film permits issued for a zip code and the median income. This was quickly disproved. Even among a small survey of NYU peers, the consensus was that there was probably a positively correlated relationship. Looking more carefully at the income distribution along with the permit distribution maps, one starts to get the sense that there really shouldn't be a correlation. This suggests that perhaps our assumptions about filming or income distribution in Manhattan are just incorrect. That said, it's still true that income is concentrated in the lower half of Manhattan, and so are film permits. However, at the more granular level of zip codes, we lose the correlation."
