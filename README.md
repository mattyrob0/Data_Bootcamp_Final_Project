# Data_Bootcamp_Final_Project
My final project on film permit data in NYC

This project was completed by Matthew Robinson in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232,
Data Bootcamp, Spring 2018. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project.

In particular, I have:
Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own.
The incorporation of the work of others–including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative
expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or paraphrasing
thereof– has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text
and the bibliography.

And I understand that:
Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester
or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden.
I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for
the project and course.

Project Description

This project analyzes film permits for NYC from the past 6 years. It asks the question: where are people filming in Manhattan
Analysis is done at the zip code level and looks year-to-year and season-to-season. Additionally, the project seeks a
correlation with zip code median income. The project concludes with a trend examination.
